The following are the files including basic IoT applications using various boards
If a file be hemIoT__
DESCRIPTION:
none: using serial input to turn an LED on/off
2: there are three LEDs we must switch on and off the LED in order
3: Considering a sensor which gives value as 1 when there is obstruction and 0 when there is no obstruction and trigger the LED if there is any obstruction
4: Using bluetooth module to switch an LED on/off
5: Control the bluetooth module using Serial monitor of Ardiono IDE (you have a button in the module to switch it between command mode and data mode press it)
6: using NodeMCU to connect to the nearby router and priniting the IP address of NodeMCU
7: the same above code where unless the NodeMCU is connected the LED blinks and it prints the nearby network and the recieved signal strength
8: The same above code with printing the encryption type of the network
9: Interfacing DHT sensor with NodeMCU
10: Above code with uploading the data to cloud (ThingsSpeak.com)
11: performing the same above code using AT commands to control the WiFi module(ESP8266EX)
12: Switching An LED on/off using things speak (give input at things speak and the LED switches off here)
